# Plasma Siege - Executive Summary

## Project Vision
Plasma Siege is a competitive, browser-based space arena game that bridges Web2 and Web3 gaming. Players pilot upgradeable spaceships in zero-gravity combat, battling to push an energy orb into the opponent's goal while collecting PLASMA tokens. The game features a unique progression system where ships can be minted as NFTs upon reaching level 10.

## Core Game Concept
- **Genre**: Physics-driven space combat arena
- **Platform**: WebGL (browser-based)
- **Players**: 1v1 (vs AI initially, PvP planned)
- **Objective**: Push plasma orb along dynamic spline path into opponent's goal
- **Match Duration**: 5 minutes or first to 3 goals

## Technology Stack
- **Game Engine**: Unity 6000.1.9f1 LTS with URP
- **Blockchain**: Solana (devnet ‚Üí mainnet)
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, database)
- **Automation**: n8n workflows
- **Development**: Claude Code with MCP integration
- **Platform**: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS (Linux)

## Token Economy Overview

### PLASMA Token
- **Symbol**: PLASMA (8 decimals)
- **Network**: Solana
- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000,000 PLASMA
- **Token Mint**: `3UDziHJzxc7yLthFFdXYwRTPYvGD5i5UW7EtcTndwuA7` (devnet)

### Economy Flow
- **New Player Bonus**: 1,000 PLASMA tokens
- **Match Entry Fee**: 10 PLASMA
- **Win Reward**: 20 PLASMA
- **Token Pickups**: 1-5 PLASMA per pickup
- **Ship Costs**:
  - Scout: Free (starter ship)
  - Fighter: 500 PLASMA
  - Destroyer: 2,000 PLASMA
- **NFT Minting**: 100 PLASMA (at level 10)

## Ship System

### Three Tiers
| Ship Type | Shield | Speed | Weapon Slots | Cost | Role |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------------|------|------|
| Scout | 100 | 80 | 1 | Free | Agile interceptor |
| Fighter | 200 | 60 | 2 | 500 PLASMA | Balanced all-rounder |
| Destroyer | 300 | 40 | 3 | 2,000 PLASMA | Heavy assault tank |

### Progression & NFTs
- Ships earn XP from matches (100 base, 200 for wins)
- 10 levels total (1,000 XP per level)
- At level 10, ships can be minted as NFTs
- NFTs preserve upgrades and match history
- Tradeable on secondary markets

### Upgrade System
Each ship has 9 modular upgrade slots:
- **3 Fuel Slots**: Boost capacity and regeneration
- **3 Shield Slots**: Defense and regeneration
- **3 Weapon Slots**: Damage output and abilities
