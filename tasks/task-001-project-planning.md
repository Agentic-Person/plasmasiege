# Task 001: Project Planning & Documentation

**Date**: 2025-07-07
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

## Objective
Create comprehensive project planning documentation and reorganize existing TODO structure into an 8-week phased development plan.

## What Was Done

### 1. Reviewed All Project Documentation
- Read 4 files in `/docs/` folder:
  - `plasma-siege-gdd-updated.md` - Game Design Document
  - `plasma-siege-prd-final.md` - Product Requirements Document
  - `plasma-seige-tech-implementation-linux.md` - Technical Implementation Guide
  - `claude-code-unity-complete.md` - Unity Instructions
- Reviewed `TODO.md` and `N8N_WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Found and reviewed `.claude/claude.md` configuration file

### 2. Created Executive Summary
**File**: `/docs/executive-summary.md`
- Project vision and core concept
- Technology stack overview
- Token economy details
- Ship system and progression
- 8-week development timeline
- Current status and success metrics

### 3. Updated TODO.md
**Changes Made**:
- Reorganized from stage-based to phase-based structure
- Created 7 phases over 8 weeks:
  - Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1)
  - Phase 2: Core Game Systems (Weeks 2-3)
  - Phase 3: Token Economy Integration (Week 4)
  - Phase 4: NFT & Progression (Week 5)
  - Phase 5: Arena & AI (Week 6)
  - Phase 6: Backend Integration (Week 7)
  - Phase 7: Polish & Optimization (Week 8)
- Added specific tasks for each phase
- Included success criteria and quick commands

### 4. Updated Claude Configuration
**File**: `.claude/claude.md`
- Updated development priorities to 8-week plan
- Modified current implementation status
- Added recent changes section
- Documented recent decisions

## Key Insights Learned

1. **Project Status**: 
   - PLASMA token already deployed: `3UDziHJzxc7yLthFFdXYwRTPYvGD5i5UW7EtcTndwuA7`
   - NFT collection created: `AjK1Zqpd4FTupZN9yD6ETGwRUWKFAeJES2Zki7HWTezj`
   - Unity project exists but needs configuration

2. **Immediate Priority**: MCP server setup is blocking all Unity development

3. **Architecture**: 
   - Unity 6000.1.9f1 LTS for game
   - Solana devnet for blockchain
   - Supabase for backend
   - N8N for workflow automation

## Next Steps
1. Set up MCP servers (Unity & N8N)
2. Configure Unity project settings
3. Implement basic ship physics

## Files Created/Modified
- ✅ Created: `/docs/executive-summary.md`
- ✅ Modified: `/home/benton/projects/plasmasiegeprj/TODO.md`
- ✅ Modified: `/home/benton/projects/plasmasiegeprj/.claude/claude.md`
- ✅ Created: `/home/benton/projects/plasmasiegeprj/tasks/` folder

## Lessons for Next Time
- Always check for existing blockchain deployments before planning
- MCP integration is critical for Claude Code functionality
- Phase-based planning provides clearer milestones than feature-based
