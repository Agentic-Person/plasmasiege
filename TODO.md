# Plasma Siege TODO List

## Current Status
- ✅ **Project Planning**: Comprehensive 8-week development plan created
- ✅ **Blockchain**: PLASMA token and NFT collection deployed on Solana devnet
- ✅ **MCP SERVERS**: Unity MCP server working, connected and ready
- 🔶 **Phase 1**: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1 - PARTIAL/ISSUES FOUND)
- ⏳ **Phases 2-7**: Core systems, economy, NFTs, polish (Weeks 2-8)

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED (MUST FIX TOMORROW)
1. **Mouse Control Broken**: Cursor must leave Unity window to turn ship - makes flight impossible
2. **Arena Too Small**: Current 100x60x100 needs to be 500x300x500 (5x larger)
3. **Ship Model Missing**: Need to implement imported Striker.fbx for orientation cues
4. **Arena Not Integrated**: Scripts created but not added to Unity scene yet
